Dementia prediction using machine learning
# introduction
Alzheimer’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder of uncertain cause and pathogenesis that primarily affects older adults and is the most common cause of dementia.

The earliest clinical manifestation of AD is selective memory impairment and while treatments are available to ameliorate some symptoms, there is no cure currently available.

As the number of dementia patients increases dramatically, the socioeconomic, psychological, physical, and economic burdens for dependents’ families are also increasing.So in order to overcome this, Machine learning models are implemented for early diagnosis model for dementia that reduces the time and economic burden and can help simplify the diagnosis method for dementia.

# proposed system

Dementia prediction with the help of machine learning (ML) in early diagnosis offers several advantages:


Early detection of dementia, enabling timely intervention and treatment.
Improved accuracy compared to traditional diagnostic approaches. 
Personalized risk assessment based on multiple factors. 
Integration of diverse data sources for a comprehensive assessment. 
Generates data for research and discovery of new insights. 
Cost-effective and scalable implementation in healthcare settings.
